## Dataset

> Ford GoBike, like other bike share systems, consists of a fleet of specially designed, sturdy and durable bikes that are locked into a network of docking stations throughout the city. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station in the system, making them ideal for one-way trips. People use bike share to commute to work or school, run errands, get to appointments or social engagements and more. It's a fun, convenient and affordable way to get around.

1.I chose Ford GoBike System Data : https://www.fordgobike.com/system-data as my source data
2.This data set includes information about individual rides made in a bike-sharing system covering the greater San Francisco Bay area.
3.Multiple data files will need to be joined together if a full yearâ€™s coverage is desired.

## Summary of Findings 

> There are two types of users in this system: Subscribers and Customers. 
Subscibers are daily commutes.they have short trip durations and rent a bike during the office hours(going and coming back). These timings are 7-9am and 5-6pm
Customers are tourists or occassional riders.They use the system on weekends. They travel for longer periods of time. According the analysis, I found subscribers tend to rend the bikes for longer trips. 

> The short period of usage for subscribers corresponds to their usage of bikes during rush hours(8-9am and 5-6pm) Monday to Friday, indicating the use is for work commute. The pattern of customer shows that they're taking advantage of the bike sharing system a lot over weekends for city tour or leisure purpose probably. 


## Key Insights for Presentation

> Different usage pattern between the two type of users is observed from the exploration. Subscribers use the system on week days  whereas customers ride a lot on weekends, especially in the afternoon. Many trips concentrated around 8-9am and 5-6pm on work days for subscribers. The short period of usage for subscribers corresponds to their usage of bikes during rush hours(8-9am and 5-6pm) Monday to Friday, indicating the use is for work commute.
